# Fishing effort data wrangling script

This is a python script I wrote to wrangle data downloaded from Global Fishing Watch's public fishing effort [dataset](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-fishing-effort). In the original dataset the vessel detections are stored day by day in CSV files, with each year being a zip directory that contains 366 or 365 CSVs. This script takes in one of these directory of CSVs (so a years worth) as an console input and then creates a new CSV file which the user can name. This file contains all vessel detections that occured within the 'bounding box' of the greater puget sound. It requires python 3.9+ and for pandas to be installed to run.
