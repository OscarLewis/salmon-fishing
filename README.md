# Impact of commercial fishing on nearshore salmon habitats
This is a repository containing data for use in my Geography 462 group project examining the impact of commercial fishing on nearshore Salmon habitats in the Puget Sound.

## Datasets
This repo contains 3 datasets:

* Benthic Quality data from [Puget Sound Stream Benthos Partnership](https://pugetsoundstreambenthos.org/Biotic-Integrity-Map.aspx).
* Fishing Effort data from [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/).
* Seagrass Monitoring data from [Washington Department of Natural Resources](https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/).

All data has been converted to the [GeoPackage](https://github.com/OscarLewis/salmon-fishing/wiki/GeoPackage-Explanation) format (.GPKG) and projected in [ESPG:6339](https://epsg.io/6339).

Please read the documentation for each dataset in their respective folders, additional information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/OscarLewis/salmon-fishing/wiki).
